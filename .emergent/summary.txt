<analysis>
The AI engineer effectively extended the ECHO SHOP FinAI system through several distinct phases, primarily driven by user requests for new functionalities. Initial work involved integrating bank accounts, investments, and credit cards, and ensuring transaction linkage and balance updates. Following this, a comprehensive **Stock Control System** was implemented, covering models, CRUD endpoints, and full frontend components for serialized and non-serialized items, customer/supplier tracking, and movements. Concurrently, menu reorganization placed core financial tools under a Configurações submenu, and a user deletion button was added. The existing bank statement import feature was confirmed functional. A critical issue with the **Dashboard's total account balance display** was identified and resolved. Most recently, a large-scale **CRM system** was built in three phases, encompassing backend models, CRUD, a Kanban frontend, automated WhatsApp lead capture, AI agent integration (using Emergent LLM), and advanced features like metrics and LGPD compliance. The immediate pending task is to fix a recurring WhatsApp QR code issue specifically in the deployment environment.

<product_requirements>
The ECHO SHOP FinAI system aims for AI-powered expense management and reconciliation, with omnichannel input via WhatsApp. Initial features included authentication, core financial management (categories, cost centers, auto-entries, dashboards), and security. Previously implemented enhancements focused on import/export of financial data (CSV, Excel, OFX, PDF), AI analysis (with a statistical fallback), detailed reports with charts, and integration of bank accounts, investments, and credit cards with transaction linking and balance updates.

Recent major requirements and their implementations include:
*   **Stock Control System:** Full management of serialized and non-serialized equipment, including comprehensive fields (name, category, manufacturer, cost, value, photo, supplier), individual history/warranty for serialized items, quantity control for non-serialized. Detailed stock movements (entry, exit, transfer, return, loss, rental) integrated with the financial system. Location tracking (deposits, customer assignments). Reports (inventory, movements, value, low stock, warranty), barcode/QR, export, dashboard.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:** Reorganization of the sidebar menu into a Configurações section (containing categories, cost centers, accounts, WhatsApp, users). Addition of a user deletion button in the user management panel. Display of total account balance on the Dashboard.
*   **CRM System:** A multi-user web CRM with native WhatsApp integration, automatic contact/message capture, sales funnel classification (rules + ML), lead routing to salespeople, trainable AI agent for responses (Emergent LLM), Kanban interface for opportunities, automation/templates, multi-role permissions, security, audit logs, LGPD compliance, and REST/WebSocket API. This was built in three phases covering MVP, Automation & AI, and Advanced features (metrics, reports, LGPD, advanced AI).

<pending_tasks>
-   **AI Extraction Issue (LiteLLM_VerificationTokenTable):** The underlying error for AI classification during WhatsApp processing was not directly resolved, leading to a statistical fallback in earlier AI analysis features.
-   **Audio Transcription:** The backend endpoint  still provides simulated transcription; real audio transcription is pending.
-   **Full LLM integration for AI Analysis (FinAI):** The AI analysis features (patterns, anomalies, predictions) for the FinAI system (not CRM) are using statistical fallbacks.
-   **Testing of Import Formats (Excel, OFX, PDF):** While endpoints for these formats exist, only CSV import was explicitly tested and confirmed functional.
-   **WhatsApp QR Code Issue on Deploy:** The QR code generation/display is not functioning correctly when deployed, requiring investigation and fix by a deployment agent.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical issue reported by the user: O QR COD DO WHATSAPP NAO FUNCIONA QUANDO SOBE PARA o deploy resolve pra gente (The WhatsApp QR code does not work when deployed, please fix it for us).

This indicates that the WhatsApp integration, which was previously fixed to run and generate QR codes locally (by configuring the  in supervisor and ensuring its operation and logging), is failing in the deployment environment. The AI engineer's last action was to call the deployment agent to diagnose and correct this specific issue. The deployment agent identified the problem, and the AI engineer confirmed the intention to proceed with the correction.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to implement the fix for the WhatsApp QR code not working on deploy, as diagnosed by the deployment agent.
