The AI engineer successfully built the FinAI system incrementally. Initial steps involved setting up the basic FastAPI/React/MongoDB structure, creating core functionalities like authentication, company setup, and a financial dashboard. A significant part of the work focused on integrating WhatsApp for expense capture, which involved setting up a Baileys service, creating proxy endpoints in the backend, and developing frontend components for QR code display and status updates. Security enhancements were also implemented, including strong password validation, rate limiting, and data sanitization. Branding was customized to ECHO SHOP. Recurring issues included frontend compilation errors, backend routing ( order), and persistent  errors affecting AI processing. Towards the end, while text message processing appeared to register transactions, a discrepancy in company IDs was identified as a possible reason for the user's perception of not registered. Audio support was partially implemented with a simulated transcription.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a FinAI â€“ Omnichannel Financial System with AI capabilities for expense capture, classification, and reconciliation.
**Core Features:**
*   **Authentication:** Login/password, user creation, access profiles (admin, financeiro, leitura).
*   **Financial Management:** Categories, cost centers, automatic financial entries with AI validation.
*   **Omnichannel Input:** Receive expenses via WhatsApp (PDF, audio, text).
*   **Data Extraction & Validation:** Extract details (vendor, CNPJ/CPF, date, items, values, taxes, payment method) from WhatsApp input, validate, normalize, and seek confirmation for ambiguities.
*   **AI Classification:** Classify expenses by category and cost center using rules and AI (suggest top-3 options with scores, auto-confirm if no response).
*   **Database Registration:** Record transactions with linking to company, user, account, category, cost center, payment method, and proof (URL/hash).
*   **Reporting:** Generate comprehensive dashboards (Revenue, Expense, Cash Flow, DRE, Payables/Receivables, Projections, Anomalies, KPIs) and reports.
*   **Security:** Login/password with hashing, session tokens, optional 2FA, permissions, audit trails, LGPD compliance (data masking).

**Implementation Details:**
*   **MVP Priority:** Authentication, Company setup, Manual transactions, Dashboard.
*   **AI/LLM:** Emergent LLM key with OpenAI GPT-5 (later updated for retry/timeout).
*   **OCR:** OpenAI Vision (gpt-image-1).
*   **WhatsApp Integration:** Initially a mock interface, then implemented using Baileys (WhatsApp Web API) with a backend proxy for real-time messages.
*   **Branding:** FinAI replaced with ECHO SHOP logo and name.
*   **User Management:** Public registration removed; only administrators can create users via a dedicated admin panel.
*   **Pending Enhancements:** Full audio transcription (currently simulated), and resolving the company ID mismatch during transaction registration.

<pending_tasks>
-   **AI Extraction Issue:** The  error persists, causing AI extraction for WhatsApp messages to fail despite successful transaction registration.
-   **Company ID Mismatch:** Investigate why transactions recorded by the WhatsApp service might be associated with a different company ID than the one the logged-in admin user is viewing.
-   **Audio Transcription:** The current audio processing endpoint in the backend is a simulated one; full, real audio transcription needs to be implemented.
-   **Dashboard Data:** The trajectory does not explicitly confirm that all dashboard data elements (projections, anomalies, KPIs) are fully implemented and functional based on collected data.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was debugging a user-reported issue where WhatsApp messages, despite showing Dados extraÃ­dos com sucesso! and TransaÃ§Ã£o registrada automaticamente!, were perceived by the user as not registered in the system.

The investigation revealed the following:
1.  **AI Extraction Failure (Recurring):** The backend logs showed  and the persistent  error, indicating that the AI classification and extraction process was still failing internally due to issues with the  or its proxy.
2.  **Transaction *Was* Created:** A direct query to MongoDB confirmed that the transaction (e.g., ) *was* successfully inserted into the database.
3.  **Company ID Mismatch Suspected:** The AI engineer then checked the  associated with the admin user () and noticed it was different from the  present in the newly created transaction ().

The current state is that WhatsApp text messages are being received and processed by the Baileys service, forwarded to the backend, and despite internal AI classification errors, the system is attempting to record a transaction. The transaction is indeed being stored in MongoDB, but there's a strong suspicion that it's being associated with an incorrect or unviewable company ID for the currently logged-in user, leading to the user's perception of it not being registered. Additionally, the support for audio messages is currently using a simulated transcription endpoint in the backend.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and resolve the company ID mismatch to ensure WhatsApp-processed transactions are visible to the correct user/company.
